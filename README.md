This library offers a curated collection of high-quality SVG icons from various icon packs. All icons are available for free download and are licensed under MIT, CC0, or CC-BY-SA licenses.

Those icons were downloaded from Iconfinder.com, the service that closed in November 2025. All rights belong to their respective authors. I do not own any of the icons provided in this library. If you are an creator and want your icons to be removed from this library, please contact me.
